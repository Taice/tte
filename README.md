# TTE (Taice Text Editor)

## Is it any good?
no, not really

## Should I use it?
no, probably not

## How do I use it?
- you clone git repo
- you cargo build --release
- you cargo run --release (filename) or ./target/release/tte (filename) 

## ty 
no porblem

## FYI
- this uses vim binds. if you don't know them, your loss.
- this is also missing many vim binds, if they aren't present don't be surprised
